            Hi, my name is Tyree Cowell and I'm a learning engineer/educational researcher. While pursuing my bachelors degree at the University of Michigan I first focused on linguistics and how humans acquire language, but I soon pivoted to learning about Artificial Intelligence, and how it could be used to understand the black box of human cognition.
            I then spent the next 3 years working in AI research, developing intelligent training solutions for DoD customers at Soar Technology. It ws there that I gained an appreciation for the learning sciences and knew that I wanted to put my talents towards improving education at a larger scale.
            To further this goal, I pursued a Masters degree at Carnegie Mellon in educational technology and applied learning sciences. There I learned about best practices in online education, principles of interaction design, and cutting edge research in educational technology.
            <br>
            I am now ready to apply what I've learned to a research or learning engineer role in the educational technology industry. My goal is always to translate research into practice and improve education with evidence-based interventions.
            Navigate around this website to learn more about my background and my work. Feel free to contact me with any questions or opportunities!        </div>
