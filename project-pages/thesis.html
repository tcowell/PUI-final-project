                    One of the most overwhelming challenges facing researchers in Cognitive Science today is the mystery of how the brain parses and comprehends language. Studies in Computer Science are plagued by a similar challenge: how to create a program that can effectively process the grammar of human languages. Through this thesis, I hope to combine these two problems by comparing certain outputs of Google's SyntaxNet to EEG data of subjects listening to naturalistic language data, more specifically, Alice in Wonderland text. 
                    The Natural Language Processor I will be analyzing (SyntaxNet) processes each sentence incrementally. At each new state of the parser, it decides to perform one of three actions. I extracted the timing and frequency of these decisions, pairing them with each word they were based on. Similarly, the EEG data collected by Dr. Brennan's Lab at the University of Michigan couples brain signals with the time at which a subject heard a specific word. 
                    Cross-referencing these two data sets allowed us to test the hypothesis that the parser's actions correspond, in some way, to cognitive actions that humans use to understand sentences. Our results showed that there is a correlation between the changing stack depth of the parser and positive frontal activation in the brain. There is also a correlation between number of right arcs and late negative activation. 
                    While these results have a number of possible causes, they support the hypothesis that natural language parsers may be useful in providing a plausible model for the black box of language comprehension in the human brain.
